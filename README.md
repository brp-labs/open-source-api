<h3>Workflow</h3>

The workflow of this application is as follows: <b>Visual Studio</b> is used to write the code, and <b>GitHub</b> is used to store the code. The code is then deployed to <b>Azure Static Web Apps</b>. This CI/CD pipeline is automated using <b>GitHub Actions</b>.
<h3>Proxy</h3>

I have made a little piece of middleware that serves as a proxy for the API. This is done to avoid CORS issues.
